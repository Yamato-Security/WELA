# About WELA
**WELA (Windows Event Log Analyzer, ゑ羅)** is a tool for auditing Windows event log settings.
Windows event logs are a vital source of information for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), providing visibility into system activity and security events.
**Unfortunately, default configurations often lead to problems such as limited log retention, insufficient audit policies, and blind spots that reduce detection capability**.
WELA helps uncover these weaknesses and offers practical recommendations to improve audit settings and enhance security visibility.
WELA also assesses log configurations **based on real-world Sigma rule coverage**, allowing users to evaluate what can or cannot be detected under current the settings.

# Features
- Auditing Windows event log audit policy settings.
- Checking **based on the major Windows event log audit configuration guidelines**.
- Checking Windows event log audit settings based on **real-world Sigma rule detectability**.
- Auditing of Windows event log file sizes and suggestions for the recommended size.

# Prerequisites
* Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core
* Running PowerShell with Administrator privileges

# Downloads

Please download the latest stable version of WELA from the [Releases](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/wela/releases) page.

# Running WELA
1. Unzip the [release zip file](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/wela/releases).
2. Open PowerShell with **Administrator privileges**.
3. `./WELA.ps1 help` to run WELA and see the help usage.

# Command List
- `audit-settings`: Check Windows event log audit policy settings.
- `audit-filesize`: Check Windows event log file size.
- `update-rules`: Update WELA's Sigma rules config files.

# Command Usage
## audit-settings
The `audit-settings` command checks the Windows event log audit policy settings and compares them with the recommended settings from [Yamato Security](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/EnableWindowsLogSettings), [Microsoft(Sever/Client)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations), and [Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-monitoring/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding).
`RuleCount` indicates the number of [Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) that can detect events within that category.

### `audit-settings` command examples
Check with the default Yamato Security's recommended settings and save results to CSV:  
```
./WELA.ps1 audit-settings
```

Check with the Australian Signals Directorate's recommended settings and save results to CSV:  
```
./WELA.ps1 audit-settings -BaseLine ASD
```

Check with Microsoft's recommended Server OS settings and display results in a GUI:  
```
./WELA.ps1 audit-settings -BaseLine Microsoft_Server -OutType gui
```

Check with Microsoft's recommended Client OS settings and display results in table format:  
```
./WELA.ps1 audit-settings -BaseLine Microsoft_Client -OutType table
```

## audit-filesize
The `audit-filesize` command checks the Windows event logs' file size and compares them with the recommended settings from Yamato Security's recommendations.

### `audit-filesize` command examples
Check the Windows event log file size with Yamato Security's recommendations and save results to CSV:  
```
./WELA.ps1 audit-filesize
```

## update-rules
#### `update-rules` command examples
Update WELA's Sigma rules config files:  
```
./WELA.ps1 update-rules
```
